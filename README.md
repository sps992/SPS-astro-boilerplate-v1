# Forked From Astro minimal template

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Astro project, has the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚    pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
|    storyblok/
|      â””â”€â”€ [components]
|    styles/
|      â””â”€â”€ tailwind.css
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Put all Astro components in `src/components/`.

All StoryBlok components in `src/storyblok`

Any static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory. All component assets like header images, should be uploaded to the Storyblok media library.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
